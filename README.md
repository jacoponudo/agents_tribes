# Agents Tribes
"agents_tribes" simulates opinion dynamics through interactions between agents using Large Language Models (LLMs). The project models how opinions evolve within different tribes or groups, exploring the effects of communication, influence, and external factors on opinion formation, polarization, and convergence.
