1,Anna Gonzalez,0,"Your Tweet:  Hmm, Theory XYZ claiming a red sky on clear sunny days... interesting.  I'm not familiar with this theory, so I'm not sure what to make of it.  Anyone else heard of this? #TheoryXYZ #RedSky #Curious",Daniel Harris,-2,"Reasoning:
As Daniel Harris, I haven't heard of this Theory XYZ before.  The tweet mentions a red sky on clear sunny days, which goes against my own lifelong experience.  I've seen plenty of sunny days, and the sky has always been blue. This person's tweet doesn't give me any reason to believe this theory.  I'm skeptical, but open to hearing more. My current belief leans strongly towards disbelief.  I need more information before I can form a firm opinion.",-2,0
